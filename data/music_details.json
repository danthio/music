give you the life that I never had\\r\\nI can see you\\'re sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh\\r\\nI can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry\\r\\n\\'Cause you\\'re scared, I ain\\'t there?\\r\\nDaddy\\'s with you in your prayers\\r\\nNo more crying, wipe them tears\\r\\nDaddy\\'s here, no more nightmares\\r\\nWe gon\\' pull together through it, we gon\\' do it\\r\\nLainie Uncle\\'s crazy, ain\\'t he?\\r\\nYeah, but he loves you girl and you better know it\\r\\nWe\\'re all we got in this world\\r\\nWhen it spins, when it swirls\\r\\nWhen it whirls, when it twirls\\r\\nTwo little beautiful girls\\r\\nLookin\\' puzzled, in a daze\\r\\nI know it\\'s confusing you\\r\\nDaddy\\'s always on the move, mamma\\'s always on the news\\r\\nI try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems\\r\\nThe harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me\\r\\nAll the things growing up as daddy, that he had to see\\r\\nDaddy don\\'t want you to see but you see just as much as he did\\r\\nWe did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me\\r\\nBut things have got so bad between us\\r\\nI don\\'t see us ever being together ever again\\r\\nLike we used to be when we was teenagers\\r\\nBut then of course everything always happens for a reason\\r\\nI guess it was never meant to be\\r\\nBut it\\'s just something we have no control over and that\\'s what destiny is\\r\\nBut no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep\\r\\nMaybe one day we\\'ll wake up and this will all just be a dream\\r\\n\\r\\nNow hush little baby, don\\'t you

forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying\\r\\n\\'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job\\r\\nBut his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom\\r\\nAnd at the time every house that we lived in\\r\\nEither kept getting broken into and robbed\\r\\nOr shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar\\r\\nTryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college\\r\\nAlmost had a thousand dollars \\'til someone broke in and stole it\\r\\nAnd I know it hurts so bad it broke your momma\\'s heart\\r\\nAnd it seemed like everything was just startin\\' to fall apart\\r\\nMom and dad was arguin\\' a lot so momma moved back\\r\\nOn the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment\\r\\nAnd dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara\\r\\nAnd that\\'s when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre\\r\\nAnd flew you and momma out to see me\\r\\nBut daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me\\r\\nThen you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn\\'t like it\\r\\nAnd you and Lainie were too young to understand it\\r\\nPapa was a rollin\\' stone, momma developed a habit\\r\\nAnd it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it\\r\\nI\\'m just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand\\r\\n\\'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud\\r\\nNow I\\'m sitting in this empty house, just reminiscing\\r\\nLookin\\' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out\\r\\nTo see how much you both have grown, it\\'s almost like you\\'re sisters now\\r\\nWow, I guess you pretty much are and daddy\\'s still here\\r\\nLainie I\\'m talkin\\' to you too, daddy\\'s still here\\r\\nI like the sound of that, yeah\\r\\nIt\\'s got a ring to it don\\'t it?\\r\\nShh, mama\\'s only gone for the moment\\r\\n\\r\\nNow hush little baby, don\\'t you cry\\r\\nEverything\\'s gonna be alright\\r\\nStiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya\\r\\nDaddy\\'s here to hold ya through the night\\r\\nI know mommy\\'s not here right now and we don\\'t know why\\r\\nWe fear how we feel inside\\r\\nIt may seem a little crazy, pretty baby\\r\\nBut I promise mama\\'s gon\\' be alright\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd if you ask me to\\r\\nDaddy\\'s gonna buy you a mockingbird\\r\\nI\\'mma give you the world\\r\\nI\\'mma buy a diamond ring for you\\r\\nI\\'mma sing for you\\r\\nI\\'ll do anything for you to see you smile\\r\\nAnd if that mockingbird don\\'t sing and that ring don\\'t shine\\r\\nI\\'mma break that birdie\\'s neck\\r\\nI\\'ll go back to the jeweler who sold it to

Oh, you got a man?\\r\\nFuck, I don\\'t care\\r\\nTell him I\\'m queer\\r\\nSave my name as Susan in your contacts\\r\\nAnd fuck your relationship, I ain\\'t worried about that\\r\\nCan I use that red marker, sir?\\r\\nLet me write my number on this hundred for you\\r\\nMake sure you hit me up when your boyfriend can\\'t do nothing for you\\r\\n(508) -507-2209\"\\r\\nShe got home and opened her purse as soon as she gets to the door\\r\\nCounting them dollars, smoking tree while she sit on the floor\\r\\nI don\\'t think she like how this shit make her feel\\r\\nBut you gotta do what you gotta do when it\\'s time for paying bills\\r\\nFor real\\r\\nShe wanna get high now, uhh\\r\\nGrab the Benjamin off the floor, she feeling alive now, uhh\\r\\nFew grams of coke on the table\\r\\nThat\\'s the right now, uhh\\r\\nShe rolled a hundred up and stuck it up her nose like\\r\\nThat\\'s what she call heaven\\'s door\\r\\nThat\\'s what she call Snow White, the white without seven dwarfs\\r\\nShe throw a hundred back at her purse and headed down to the store\\r\\nShe needed blunts for the gas\\r\\nShe needed gas for the Ford\\r\\nShe needed eggs and some dill\\r\\nShe needed cheese and some milk\\r\\nShe needed change\\r\\n\\r\\n[Cashier:]\\r\\n\"What what number is that?\\r\\nI said what number is that on the bill, what is that?\\r\\nYes, in red, it\\'s like a phone

bread and place your hands on top of your head\\r\\nTake my tough advice\\r\\nTurn around and count to a hundred if you love your life\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNow keep it a 100\\r\\nUhh, keep it a 100\\r\\nYeah, keep it a 100\\r\\nOne hundred\\r\\nKeep it a 100\\r\\n\\r\\nYo\\r\\nSomebody told me money rules the world\\r\\nI know you heard that shit\\r\\nMoney\\'s the root to all evil\\r\\nBlessings and murder shit\\r\\nHe put that hundred inside of collection plate on Sunday too\\r\\nHope that it\\'ll take away your sins\\r\\nMaybe someday soon\\r\\nBut anyway they covered the plate and just continued praying\\r\\nAfter church the pastor opened it up and started saying\\r\\n\"Lord forgive me but I need this, I\\'ve been really static\"\\r\\nAnd he grabbed the hundred off the top and started staring at it\\r\\nHeld it up to see if it\\'s real or fake\\r\\nThen looked around to make sure nobody was looking\\r\\nAnd then he took it\\r\\nDamn\\r\\nOff to the streets with the Lord\\r\\nOff to go find him a whore\\r\\nA hundred bucks in the dash and now he riding the course\\r\\nHe see some bitch on the corner\\r\\nHe told her hop in the car\\r\\nAnd then she opened the door\\r\\n\"Come on bitch, yo hurry the fuck up\\r\\nI ain\\'t tryna get caught up\"\\r\\nThen continued driving his stuff\\r\\nLooking for a spot in the cut\\r\\n\"-How much for head?\\r\\n-A hundred\\r\\n-Now how much for sex?\\r\\n-A hundred\\r\\n-Damn, a hundred?\\r\\n-Come on, that\\'s not a lot\\r\\n-Fuck\\r\\n-Why you playing?\\r\\n-Nah, I\\'m just saying, that\\'s a lot, bitch\\r\\nLike gotta calm down, damn\"\\r\\nNow she making eye contact\\r\\nShe got on eye contacts\\r\\nShe see that Benjamin Frank\\r\\nShe keep her eyes on that\\r\\nShe\\'s thinking \"I want that\"\\r\\nHe pulls his dick out his pants\\r\\n\"Ooh God, it\\'s good\"\\r\\nTransaction complete\\r\\nAnd she went back to the streets\\r\\nBack to the cash at the leash\\r\\nShe back to get back on her knees\\r\\nAnd she don\\'t like how this shit make her feel\\r\\nBut you gotta do what you gotta do when it\\'s time for paying bills\\r\\nFor real\\r\\nShe wanna retire soon, she swear to God\\r\\n[Smack]\\r\\nShe looked up and seen the hand of God\\r\\nOh my God\\r\\nForgot she had a pimp\\r\\nThat nigga been looking for her ass for days\\r\\nTook every single dollar and left her eye black and gray\\r\\nHe be on the corner jamming getting drunk that-a-way\\r\\n7-Eleven gambling throwing all his cash away, yup\\r\\nSome say that money rule the world\\r\\nI know you heard that shit\\r\\nMoney the root to all evil\\r\\nBlessings and murder shit\\r\\nYeah, that pimp just lost that hundred dollars in that dice game\\r\\nHe said \"I should\\'ve just bet that shit on tonight\\'s game\"\\r\\nWhatever nigga, nice game\\r\\nThe homie who won it walked off with the hundred\\r\\nThen opened up his wallet\\r\\nStuck it inside and then put it in his pocket\\r\\nStarted stomping and running\\r\\nFeeling so good, started hopping and jumping\\r\\nMoney flopping and rumbling\\r\\nHis eyes is as big as his smile\\r\\nNo stopping him from the prow\\r\\nHe\\'s jogging, skipping around\\r\\nTill his wallet fell on the ground\\r\\nA hundred sticking halfway out\\r\\nIn the back of a halfway house\\r\\nFor like three weeks\\r\\nSo don\\'t even ask me how\\r\\nCheck it\\r\\nA homeless man walks by\\r\\nSees a wallet, opens his eyes\\r\\nAnd then grabs it, opens to check what\\'s inside and to a surprise\\r\\nIt\\'s money\\r\\nA couple dollars, a hundred bill with some writing\\r\\nA number written in red\\r\\nIf he had a phone he would call, but he doesn\\'t\\r\\nSo he says \"fuck it, it\\'s mine\"\\r\\nAnd I\\'m really hungry and thirsty\\r\\nI want some beer, a beef jerky\\r\\nMaybe some ten percent juice\\r\\nAnd if the store\\'s open, I need some cigarettes too\\r\\nTrue\\r\\nHe walked into the same store on the block\\r\\nJust so happen to be the same exact store that got robbed\\r\\nWhat a coincidence\\r\\nThat shit is just as weird as I thought\\r\\nThe clerk rang him out and said\\r\\n\"That\\'ll be eighteen, twenty-five\"\\r\\nAnd then he held that hundred out with the red number written on top\\r\\nAnd then everything stopped\\r\\n\\r\\n[Voicemail:]\\r\\nYo wassup, this is Joyner\\r\\nI\\'m unable to take your call right now\\r\\nLeave me a brief message and I\\'ll get back to you, peace\\r\\n\\r\\n[Brief Message:]\\r\\nMr. Lucas, Officer Michael Bradley with the police department\\r\\nTrying to get a hold of you now, this is the third time calling\\r\\nI need to speak to you with regards to some serious charges\\r\\nYou need to get back to me as soon as possible\\r\\nOr we\\'ll be showing up at your door with about 10 officers and some handcuffs. Choice is yours\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n'"
