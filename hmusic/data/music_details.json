been a week, I already want to go home\\r\\nThey\\'re saying that, time will fly I think it\\'s going to go slow\\r\\nFrom induction to G Wing, niggas wanna know, what block, that I\\'m from, not my postcode\\r\\nCouple man clocked my face, said they rate my ting, on a low low and when I\\'m home I\\'m defo gonna blow blow\\r\\nThe water tastes like piss, the food tastes like shit\\r\\nThe window in my cell don\\'t close so it\\'s blitz\\r\\nDoing situps till I\\'m tired, pressups till I\\'m sick\\r\\nI don\\'t do squats unless I\\'m getting search stripped\\r\\nI mean, I don\\'t do squats unless I\\'m getting strip searched\\r\\nBefor\u0435 I hit the strip I need a bitch to strip first\\r\\nI was on the wing like, San\u0435 and Surge\\r\\nFree Jigga, that\\'s a real nigga fuck what you heard\\r\\nNiggas put their hands on me but, yo that ain\\'t a thing\\r\\nAnyone can get touched, when you\\'re on a pagan wing\\r\\nThat prison set me up to fail, hella niggas just watching from the landing\\r\\nBut it\\'s calm cah I don\\'t want nobody\\'s help\\r\\nAnd I don\\'t need nobody\\'s hand, or anyone to have my back\\r\\nThere weren\\'t no bleeding in my cell, so stop lying for the gram\\r\\nYo stop trolling for the snap, getting rushed didn\\'t pop down my self-esteem i came home richer than I was before\\r\\nBut now I\\'m sitting down thinking about popping doors\\r\\nNot no six figure deal or a popping tour\\r\\nWhen it rains it pours\\r\\nI got my razors in the shower, slipped once, I ain\\'t slipping anymore\\r\\nWhen I was in jail I thought about the future not the past\\r\\nBefore you see the light you gotta try maneuver through the dark\\r\\nOn the phone to my darg, he incarcerated too\\r\\nYou would think we\\'re on road, the way we\\'re both having a laugh\\r\\nFree my jail niggas, I ain\\'t seen them in a while\\r\\nTeeth too stubborn, said he\\'s taking it to trial\\r\\nI try link, scratchy and loops in the can, but the Ville said there\\'s no way I\\'m going to the Mount\\r\\nWhen I was in jail I never knew my daily duppy dropped, I spoke to crash on a Tuesday he said it\\'s going off\\r\\nI got a tired arm from whipping all these noodles nonstop\\r\\nI\\'m used to firearms and rambos not no tuna in a sock\\r\\nWhen I was in jail I wrote down some tunes that\\'s due to pop\\r\\nAnd I was in jail I worked out who\\'s real and really not\\r\\nI done some real shit for niggas, they all act like they forgot\\r\\nSo they ain\\'t hard to forget when I\\'m home, and I flex, and I wil,l no offense\\r\\nIf I ask him where he\\'s from, I got fans on the landing asking when I\\'m going to drop\\r\\nAs soon as I leave the wok, when you hear me on your radio, kick your door, till your doors asking you to stop\\r\\nI weren\\'t meant to go jail, but my plans, never go to plan\\r\\nI rap, \\'bout the trap, cah I really turned grams to grands\\r\\nDone that shit from June to June Jan to Jan\\r\\nTryna get rich off a chorus and a verse, boy I used to do, hand\\r\\nTo hands\\r\\nCan\\'t tell a lifer \"go get a life\", we\\'ll have alarm bells ringing like 20 times\\r\\nMy celly next doors, always talking \\'bout, selling drugs and eating pussy, sounds like LB and BandoBaby29\\r\\nThe judge gave me 6 months, imagine getting 25\\r\\nMy cellmates looking at a 15, he said he doesn\\'t mind\\r\\nWhen the hate don\\'t work they start telling lies like, he\\'s riding voluntary and he doesn\\'t ride\\r\\nUnreachable for a bit, if these hoes wanna shout me, they got a shout Riff\\r\\nTell my lil\\' sis grind, don\\'t rely, on a prick\\r\\nTell my mom don\\'t miss me, I\\'ll be home, in a min, I\\'ll be home, in a sec\\r\\nLabels gotta wanna make me not, wanna put coke, in a \\'rex or spin that block, for revenge\\r\\nMy niggas got a, next niggas girl looking, after the pole for some sex\\r\\nWintertime I\\'m in Louis V looking like a chessboard, I can rap, make packs fly and get your chest bored\\r\\nI hate, when a nigga says, peng raw, but it turns out, to be dead like that chick who gave me neck, on the 10th floor, dead jaw\\r\\nNever been Bora Bora, but I\\'ve been Smalley and Stillman with\\r\\nMy bora bora\\r\\nChef a nigga\\'s face tryna leave him with some trauma trauma\\r\\nUsed to do drills and sell B, in that corsa corsa, course I did\\r\\nHalf box at least don\\'t make sense robbing a quarter brick\\r\\nRiff, you should be phoning me for shows, not to hit a lick\\r\\nSaid she shy, you should see the way she spits on it, sits on it, spins on it, honestly she makes my head spin the bits\\r\\nSpinner out, heard that them pricks are trying to spin the bits\\r\\nOlders want to change their life, gunshots for them little kids\\r\\nStabbed the nigga, opposite my crib, I ain\\'t seen him since\\r\\nSummertime, niggas getting napped just for talking shit\\r\\nWhen I was in jail, I was praying for my niggas on remand looking at birds\\r\\nIf it doesn\\'t go well I done a drill, with a nigga that I, hardly know\\r\\nIf we get caught I just pray, that he doesn\\'t go tell\\r\\nI had dreams about my tape dropping\\r\\nWhen, I was in jail major label still offering\\r\\nWhen I was in jail, mom said she don\\'t want to see her son in jail\\r\\nSame, my cellmate just went, for a shit, and his shit smells\\r\\nThem jail letters got me through the day, feel sorry for them lifers not gonna lie that\\'s super pain\\r\\nRapist getting free due, 18 months just to get free, then go, do the same thing again\\r\\nWhen I was in jail, you, never write me letters\\r\\nSent me P\\'s I land road, now you feel entitled to message me\\r\\nDon\\'t be surprised, if you see and hear less of me\\r\\nI\\'m trying to stay away, from the fake love and energy\\r\\nBanged up, tallying my days\\r\\nMy cellys on remand said don\\'t rub it in his face at least you know, when you\\'re getting home\\r\\nYour sentence will go quick you don\\'t even need a Xbox or mobile phone\\r\\nI was

        "'Dave Lyrics\\r\\n\"How I Met My Ex\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLike\\r\\nI met my girl when I was 18 years old\\r\\nAnd she was just turning 23\\r\\nI really love her from my heart\\r\\nAnd even though I don\\'t deserve it fam I hope she loves me\\r\\nSo I just done this private show I\\'m doing Footlocker promo\\r\\nAnd judging from the postcode it was Shoreditch or Soho\\r\\nDid 6 or 7 tracks, made 6 or 7 racks\\r\\nA couple days later on twitter I saw this photo of myself and I was grinning\\r\\nThat 4K camera of quality had got me tripping\\r\\nSo I\\'m checking out who did it\\r\\nWhen I stumbled on this girl\\r\\nAnd I could tell that she was different\\r\\nA couple hours later now I\\'m liking all her pictures\\r\\nI ain\\'t finished\\r\\nI typed her twitter name into my Insta so I could check on every single little digit\\r\\nWhy didn\\'t I just message her?\\r\\nTrust me I was thinking, but I\\'m a self-centred rapper too concerned about my image\\r\\nThe truth\\r\\nSo when she hit me first I\\'m pretty shocked I didn\\'t burst\\r\\nI\\'m calling Josh, Jack and Juss who am I ringing first?\\r\\nMan I was so excited\\r\\nThat I replied a minute later that\\'s that bro I think that you just let her know excited\\r\\nToo excited, no clue on what I should do excited\\r\\nSo I\\'m just typing, rambling like a fool, excited\\r\\n\\r\\nLook\\r\\nLook\\r\\nAnd we were talking for hours over some minor things\\r\\nIgnoring everyone else to her I\\'m replying quick\\r\\nThis type of chick she got a spark like you were lighting spliffs\\r\\nYou know you like her when you\\'re thinking about your words\\r\\nShe got me typing, deleting my messages then re-writing\\r\\nIn the hope that there\\'s a smile when she\\'s replying\\r\\nThe highlight of my day, them phone calls in the night, it\\'s the little things\\r\\nThe girl, she had a vibe and I liked it and\\r\\nShe\\'s into photography and she\\'s got a passion for it\\r\\nAnd she respects that I\\'m rapping but she ain\\'t catting for it\\r\\nSee that\\'s the perfect balance\\r\\nThere\\'s nothing better than a girl with talent\\r\\nDrive, ambition, all of them things above\\r\\nShe\\'s showing an abundance\\r\\nI ain\\'t even met her yet\\r\\nShe works around the corner but lives just outside of London\\r\\nI ain\\'t fronting, I\\'m a sweet boy\\r\\nIntentions are in question so my compliments are decoys\\r\\nIf that even makes sense?\\r\\nThe first time I met her, I\\'m surrounded by my friends\\r\\nRandom ends on some staircase\\r\\nSo much for a first date\\r\\nI just had a show\\r\\nAnd I asked if she could meet me after\\r\\nMaybe we could chill, you never know where things could go\\r\\nNo problem she down to roll\\r\\nTravelled in the cold\\r\\nSo I went across the road, grey hoodie under a coat\\r\\nIf I\\'m remembering correctly\\r\\nIt\\'s always kind of weird when the person that you were texting\\r\\nIs the person you are obsessed with\\r\\nI was on her from the jump\\r\\nI think she was wearing pumps or Vans when I first met her, no, it\\'s either either one\\r\\nShe was looking so attractive I barely saw skin \\'cause she was covered like a mattress\\r\\nMan, I think that she\\'s the one\\r\\nI was stuck for twenty seconds tryna to give the girl a hug\\r\\nAnd all my friends are drunk so fuck it, I\\'m about to kiss her\\r\\nAny complications, I\\'m blaming it on the liquor\\r\\nChanging my name on Twitter and blocking her on my Insta\\r\\nI saw her skin blush the moment that our lips touched\\r\\nShe pulled my bottom lip until it stretched\\r\\nKissed me on my cheek until she reached around my neck\\r\\nAnd had me moaning like a bitch\\r\\nEven though I\\'m wearing jeans, I had to re-arrange my dick so she don\\'t see that I\\'m erect\\r\\nIt\\'s the first time we met, got me feeling like a creep\\r\\nAnd that strawberry flavour gave her tongue a kinda sweet little taste\\r\\nAnd we could speak about anything we were friends first\\r\\nI dropped her to the station I remember\\r\\n\\'Cause we had a conversation for ages about our dreams\\r\\nAnd the things that we hadn\\'t seen and all that we intended to do\\r\\nI bet she\\'s hoping my intentions are true\\r\\nAnd as months went by we both got into it, and intimate\\r\\nAnd I\\'ma spare you the details \\'cause both of our parents are probably listening\\r\\nBut really we were into it\\r\\nInto us, into this\\r\\nInto everything about each other we were lovers and I love her \\'cause she knows me and that\\'s probably why she told me you ain\\'t ready for a girl\\r\\nYou\\'re still a little kid that\\'s getting ready for the world and you don\\'t need that kinda burden\\r\\nBut I told her that I want it\\r\\nAnd I\\'m just being honest, yes I know that girls exist but I don\\'t see them as a problem\\r\\nI meant every single word\\r\\nAnd I ain\\'t gonna lie and say DM\\'s have been absurd but out of every single girl\\r\\nThis is the weirdest of positions\\r\\nIt\\'s usually the girl that\\'s asking where I see her fitting or a place on her position\\r\\nBut I\\'m telling her I need it\\r\\nAnd I don\\'t think she sees it, so I\\'m being even sweeter when we\\'re speaking and we\\'re meeting\\r\\nI\\'ve got affectionate messages, you could read them\\r\\nYou gotta tell a girl that she\\'s beautiful \\'til she sees it\\r\\nBelieves it, understands it more than physically\\r\\nMentally, and the way that I\\'m feeling\\r\\nI could talk 10 years about the moment that we shared\\r\\nThe jokes that we had running\\r\\nThe places that we\\'ve been\\r\\nThe music we made together producing next to my bed\\r\\nThen making my minor changes in reference to what she said\\r\\nI think I start to getting tired, my schedule\\'s a mess\\r\\nReplies are gettin\\' lazy and my lady knows it\\'s crazy\\r\\nBut she\\'s there if I\\'m in need\\r\\nWhile I\\'m at shows getting tempted by girls that are on their knees\\r\\nYou know I\\'m only a teen, it\\'s like my eyes started drifting\\r\\nNot as easy as I pictured to give your all to a woman\\r\\nIgnoring all this attention that\\'s been getting to my head\\r\\nThe sex is so accessible, one message or text and girls will get in your bed\\r\\nShe\\'s tryna make it happen with photos and her events\\r\\nI mentioned it\\'s her passion, photography is her thing\\r\\nAnd I don\\'t know if it\\'s the pressure\\r\\nWhere paper meets the passion and the pleasure\\r\\nWe all gotta work to survive\\r\\nSo now she\\'s popping up at shows\\r\\nTaking pictures on her own\\r\\nAnd at first it wasn\\'t cool\\r\\nBut fuck it we let it go\\r\\nUntil I saw her in some rapper\\'s tracksuit, I felt a way\\r\\nShe told me it was work and she was in some studio\\r\\nTaking pictures and I just sighed\\r\\nSome halfway wannabe rappers that fed her lies\\r\\nThey ain\\'t looking for no picture\\r\\nI know it\\'s your profession\\r\\nBut read their intentions\\r\\nThey ain\\'t paying male photographers to shoot that same session\\r\\nAnd that felt so disrespectful, standing on our dreams\\r\\nAnd crushing \\'em, I just told her it\\'s nothing do what you need to do\\r\\nIf I ain\\'t feeding you\\r\\nThen my opinion\\'s all I\\'m giving when I speak to you\\r\\n\\'Cause I don\\'t have the right\\r\\nWhy should girls be punished for a male\\'s dirty mind?\\r\\nWhen I think about it now, I\\'m ashamed to the core\\r\\nI mean how many men stop their women from achieving what they can because in secret they\\'ve been feeling insecure\\r\\nAnd I can\\'t handle my emotions, it\\'s probably why I didn\\'t see her\\r\\nTalent when I shoulda been supporting and promoting\\r\\nLike I didn\\'t have a platform, a voice and a following\\r\\nWith everyone I knew, I really coulda do a lot of things to help chase her dream\\r\\nBut instead of me to grow into the person that she needs\\r\\nI acted like I couldn\\'t see\\r\\nAnd I don\\'t mean to say this like I don\\'t trust the girl\\r\\nBut how can I trust her if I don\\'t trust myself?\\r\\nAnd even girls can get tempted you know how it goes\\r\\nWhat if she meets a bigger rapper when she\\'s at a show?\\r\\nWhat if he sees her backstage?\\r\\nWhat if he selling lots?\\r\\nWhat if he\\'s got a bigger car, got a better watch?\\r\\nThat doesn\\'t bother me, she really ain\\'t material\\r\\nIt\\'s all the little things they do that put the fear in you\\r\\nWhat if he actually replies?\\r\\nWhat if he phones her too?\\r\\nWhat if he\\'s doing all the things that I\\'m supposed to do?\\r\\nWhat if he\\'s listening, laughing, relating?\\r\\nWhat if he even cares to ask her how her day\\'s been?\\r\\nWhat if he\\'s trying to give her everything she needs and expects from the one damn person that she\\'s dating?\\r\\nI shoulda helped her follow her dream\\r\\nBut instead I held her back and had her following me\\r\\nAnd boys got a brave face so they\\'ll never know\\r\\nThat it hurts just as much when you let them go\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n'"
